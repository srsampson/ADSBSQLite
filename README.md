#### ADSBSQLite ADS-B Receiver Database Engine
This is a Java 8 Application that listens to ADS-B data on TCP port 30003, which is known as the Basestation Compatible port from the original ADS-B receiver from Kinetics UK.

The application reads the data in and creates database SQL statements in which to store the targets.

It can optionally display a simple GUI to show the data counts being processed.
